# ESP32 Muscle Sensor EMG Project

## Project Overview
The ESP32 Muscle Sensor EMG project demonstrates how to monitor muscle activity using an EMG sensor connected to an ESP32 microcontroller. This project can be used in various applications such as biomedical engineering, rehabilitation, and muscle activity monitoring.

## Components Needed
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- EMG (Electromyography) Sensor Module
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the EMG Sensor to ESP32:**
   - **Signal Output (emgSensorPin):** Connect the signal output pin of the EMG sensor to GPIO 34 on the ESP32.
   - **Power Supply:** Connect the EMG sensor to a suitable power supply (e.g., 3.3V or 5V and GND).

## Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize serial communication for debugging purposes using `Serial.begin(9600)`.
   - Define the GPIO pin connected to the EMG sensor (`emgSensorPin` set to 34).

2. **Operation:**
   - **Reading Sensor Data:**
     - Use `analogRead(emgSensorPin)` to read the analog value from the EMG sensor.
     - Print the read value to the Serial Monitor using `Serial.print` and `Serial.println`.
   - **Detecting Muscle Activity:**
     - Define a threshold value (e.g., 512) to determine muscle activity.
     - Compare the read EMG value with the threshold.
     - Print a message indicating whether muscle activity is detected based on the comparison.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Sensor Calibration:** Adjust the threshold value based on sensor calibration and specific application requirements.
   - **Noise Filtering:** Consider implementing additional filtering techniques if the sensor data is noisy.

## Applications
- **Biomedical Engineering:** Monitor muscle activity for medical and research purposes.
- **Rehabilitation:** Track muscle engagement during physical therapy exercises.
- **Fitness Tracking:** Measure muscle activity during workouts for performance analysis.

## Notes
- **Threshold Adjustment:** The threshold value for detecting muscle activity should be calibrated based on the specific sensor and application.
- **Data Analysis:** For more detailed analysis, consider recording the sensor data over time and processing it using specialized software.
